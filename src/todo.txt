- insert acounts struct as startup system and system to overwrite last block to get bounty (everything from networks
side is immutable--just reinsert resource or insert pointer much cleaner)
- player input (move as a system), ssytem for what happens in world, bc of that move, transform velocity
- every player should be identifiable by peerid and their info (# of money, # of bounties)
- add friends should be very easy
- easy to identify bounty
- when bounty is killed, see who kill them (event for killing and being killed in case desynched 
and missed who killed--this shoudl be multiple frames)
- resynchronization ("snapshot" state)--he doesn;t need this for blockchain side

- add object to camera, then add raycast to object
- basic objects, multiple people, combat
- wasd space left click mouse drag to adjust camera

- every time u clikc, if ur in a certain radius, u do -20 damage--everyone starts w/ 100 health
- rightclick, add as freinds

- game to networks to database but game doesnt communicate w/ database; communicater: crossbeam channel
- alr have accounts, bountry
- sending player input, which friend added, healht damage, to game side network: backroll
- sending who claimed bounty to insight network: kademlia

----------------------------------------------------------------

- read fault tolerance paper fault vs failure (ex. if game desynchs)
- bevy backroll (does everything in preupdate and is an actual plugin, shoudl be able to sign moves) 
not bevy ggrs

- limit the number of clicks per second/frame --later
----------------------------------------------------------------

- pcg buildings not showing up in backroll; i think spawning can't be in rollback. what i can do is spawn 
buildings under the plane--but the world doesn't have to look the same for each player--part of the game
could be a changing world where u never know where building will pop up (even tho this is deterministic)
