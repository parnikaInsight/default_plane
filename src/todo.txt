Today

- scale orbs
- put orbs within orbs, main orb (def plane) is heaven orb
- heaven and space orbs
- portal to travel between orbs : superdump/bevy portal-demo branch
- don't focus on architecture--it gets too heavy and slow, instead use orbs and focus on portal

----------------------------------------------------------------
- skeletal animation: rotate wasd, mesh colliders, other animations
- basic objects, multiple people, combat

- follow dolly
- add object to camera, then add raycast to object

- rose skybox

- terrain generation
- country slice grass
- rose water

- microsoft flight simulation

- pcg world
- path finding in world

- pcg creatures

----------------------------------------------------------------
Later

- kademlia address as ggrs socket

- insert acounts struct as startup system and system to overwrite last block to get bounty (everything from networks
side is immutable--just reinsert resource or insert pointer much cleaner)

- add bounty to info as bool and make true based on hash of block
- easy to identify bounty
- when bounty is killed, see who kill them (event for killing and being killed in case desynched 
and missed who killed--this shoudl be multiple frames)

- resynchronization ("snapshot" state)--he doesn;t need this for blockchain side

----------------------------------------------------------------
Other
- read fault tolerance paper fault vs failure (ex. if game desynchs)
- bevy backroll (does everything in preupdate and is an actual plugin, shoudl be able to sign moves) 
not bevy ggrs

- game to networks to database but game doesnt communicate w/ database; communicater: crossbeam channel
- alr have accounts, bounty
- sending player input, which friend added, healht damage, to game side network: backroll
- sending who claimed bounty to insight network: kademlia

- limit the number of clicks per second/frame --later
----------------------------------------------------------------
Problems
- pcg buildings not showing up in backroll; i think spawning can't be in rollback. what i can do is spawn 
buildings under the plane--but the world doesn't have to look the same for each player--part of the game
could be a changing world where u never know where building will pop up (even tho this is deterministic)

----------------------------------------------------------------
Overall
- pcg 
- asset loading
- modular
