- block creation and also despawning for path for players

- each 1x1 block should be split into many blocks to help with creating despawn path, use another seed
for each mini block and another seed for despawning for path 

----------------------------------------------------------------

- block creation shouldn't overlap: location/grid based

- block creation (timing and location) should be based on camera location 

- block creation should be bounded by region (camera fov) and plane size

- blocks should be created near each other (should propagate from center along axis perpendicular
to the camera's line of sight, and it shoudl propagate outwards in the direction that camera 
is moving towards)

- must be seed based, deterministic, order independent: noise function

- OS independent: no floating point?

- same noise/hash function, same seeds but each seed is for diff feature (height, width, # of levels, 
shape of windows for top half of building, etc.)

- map 2d plane grid position to position input for noise function
