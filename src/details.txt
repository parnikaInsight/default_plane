- InfoDisplay should move with character or scale according to distance. 
Should appear only if u hover and u (camera) is within certain distance or clicked "I" or smth
- adding a friend should have apparent UI (rn just print statement)
- when fighting, damage must also occur when bullet's pos == opponent's pos (not just radius like now)

camera
 - if first person pov, put collider on camera/ character entity
 - else, don't let camera move outside of a certain radius so it stays in earth

 annoying cursor grab
